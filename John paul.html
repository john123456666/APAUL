      My name is john paul  villarin 19 years old living in Culasian Titay Zamboanga Sibugay. My life has been a  My journey in school started a few years ago with elementary school.
    I remember being nervous and excited as I walked through the doors for the first time. I was surrounded by new faces, but I soon made friends and started to feel more comfortable.
    With the help of my teachers and classmates, I started to learn and grow and was eventually ready to move on to middle school. I'm looking forward to continuing my journey in school. 
    As I move on to high school and college I'm sure I'll be taking on even more advanced classes and exploring new subjects.
    I'm also looking forward to the opportunity to make more friends and be part of even more clubs and activities.
    I'm excited to see what the future holds and am confident I can continue to grow and succeed along the way.
